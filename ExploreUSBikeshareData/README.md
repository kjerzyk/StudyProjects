"Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used."


In the project I had to perform an exploratory analysis of the data provided by a bike-share system provider working with 3 large cities: New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC. Project involved answering a lot of questions and all of them are asked in the notebook file.
